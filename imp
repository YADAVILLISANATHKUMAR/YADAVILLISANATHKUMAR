As the access provisioning team, we are responsible for managing the identity and access of users, ensuring that access is given to financial advisors and other employees as per their roles.

As the access provisioning team, our team doesn't give access or handle certain access, so we forward the case to another team, or else we create a ticket and assign the ticket to the concerned team to resolve the issue or give access to the users.
