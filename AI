Task Name: Mobile Friendly - Agentic AI Application Analysis

Task Description:

Complete all the activities listed below and submit them in the text box provided. Remember, your task submission should be at least 150-Words.

Create a structured report analyzing how Agentic AI can optimize a specific business process in a professional services company that covers following aspects:

Select a business process (e.g., client onboarding, report generation, data analysis for a specific industry).
Analyze how Agentic AI could enhance efficiency and decision-making in the chosen process.
Describe the tasks the AI agent would perform, the data it would require, and the potential benefits.
Identify which Agentic AI core concepts (Perception, Reasoning, Planning) are most relevant to the application.
Note: "Client information is deemed confidential, so use generic client information instead. For example, ‘Retail Giant,’ ‘Pharma Company,’ ‘Global Bank, etc."



Learner's Submission:

Agentic AI can significantly improve the client onboarding process by automating repetitieve tasks and supportive decision-making. In a traditional onboarding process, employees manually collect cleint details, verify documents, create profiles, and generate onboarding reports. This process is time-consuming and prone to human error. An Agentic AI system can analyze client inputs submitted through a mobile-friendly application and guide the onboarding flow independently. The AI agent can validate documents, extract relevant information using perception capabalities, and flag missing or incorrect data. Using reasoning, it can decide the next steps, such as requesting additional documents or approving the client profile. Planning abilities allow the agent t schedule follow-ups, reminders, and onboading milestones automatically. The AI Agent would require data such as client identification details, uploaded documents, service requirements, and compliance rules. the benefits include faster onboarding, reduced manual efforts, improved accuracy, and better client experience. employees can focus on complex cases while the AI handles routine onboarding tasks efficiently.

Selected Business Process: Client Onboarding in a Professional Services Company
Overview:
Client onboarding is a critical process for professional services companies such as consulting firms, audit firms, or IT services providers. It involves collecting client requirements, validating documents, performing compliance checks, allocating internal resources, and setting up project workflows. This process is often time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to delays due to manual coordination.
How Agentic AI Enhances Efficiency and Decision-Making:
Agentic AI can significantly optimize client onboarding by acting as an autonomous agent that understands goals, analyzes inputs, and takes appropriate actions. By continuously reasoning over client data and business rules, the AI can reduce turnaround time, improve accuracy, and support better decision-making without constant human intervention.
Tasks Performed by the AI Agent:
The AI agent would collect generic client information (e.g., “Retail Giant” or “Global Bank”), validate submitted documents, perform compliance and risk checks, recommend suitable service packages, assign internal teams based on availability and expertise, and track onboarding progress. It would require access to structured data such as client profiles, service catalogs, compliance rules, internal resource data, and historical onboarding records.
Relevant Agentic AI Core Concepts:
Perception: To interpret client inputs, documents, and system data.
Reasoning: To evaluate compliance requirements, assess risks, and choose optimal onboarding actions.
Planning: To sequence tasks such as approvals, resource allocation, and milestone setup.
Potential Benefits:
Agentic AI enables faster onboarding, reduced operational costs, improved compliance accuracy, consistent decision-making, and enhanced client experience—making it a powerful tool for professional services firms.

Learner's Submission:

RCA to Low CSAT – Agentic AI Application Summary In a professional services company, low Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores can negatively impact client retention and brand reputation. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a critical business process used to identify the underlying reasons for declining CSAT. Agentic AI can optimize this process by autonomously analyzing large volumes of customer feedback and operational data from clients such as a Global Bank or Retail Giant. The AI agent perceives customer sentiment by processing survey responses, service tickets, and feedback comments. Using reasoning capabilities, it identifies patterns and correlations between low CSAT scores and factors such as delayed service delivery, communication gaps, or recurring technical issues. Through planning, the AI recommends corrective actions, prioritizes high-impact issues, and continuously tracks improvements after changes are implemented. The AI agent requires anonymized customer feedback data, service performance metrics, and resolution timelines. The key benefits include faster identification of root causes, reduced manual effort, improved accuracy, and proactive decision-making. By leveraging Agentic AI, organizations can move from reactive problem-solving to continuous service improvement, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction and stronger client relationships.


Short Comment:
A well-structured and insightful submission that correctly applies Agentic AI concepts to a real-world business challenge. The explanation is concise, relevant, and meets all task requirements. Adding measurable outcomes could further enhance the impact.

Learner's Submission:

Agentic AI refers to a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating autonomous, intelligent agents capable of making decisions, interacting with other agents, and completing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. It combines advanced AI techniques, such as Generative AI, large language models, and multi-agent systems, to enable machines to act independently, learn from experiences, and solve problems dynamically. Key characteristics of agentic AI include: Autonomy: Agents operate independently, making decisions and taking actions without constant human oversight. Goal-Oriented: They set specific objectives and work towards achieving them through their actions. Adaptive Learning: Agentic AI learns from past experiences and adapts its behavior over time to improve efficiency. Complex Problem-Solving: These systems can navigate intricate situations by considering multiple variables and potential outcomes. Agentic AI has significant potential across various industries, transforming business processes and decision-making.Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves algorithms and programming to enable machines to learn from data and make decisions.
