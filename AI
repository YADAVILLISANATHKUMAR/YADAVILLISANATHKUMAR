RCA to Low CSAT – Agentic AI Application Summary In a professional services company, low Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores can negatively impact client retention and brand reputation. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a critical business process used to identify the underlying reasons for declining CSAT. Agentic AI can optimize this process by autonomously analyzing large volumes of customer feedback and operational data from clients such as a Global Bank or Retail Giant. The AI agent perceives customer sentiment by processing survey responses, service tickets, and feedback comments. Using reasoning capabilities, it identifies patterns and correlations between low CSAT scores and factors such as delayed service delivery, communication gaps, or recurring technical issues. Through planning, the AI recommends corrective actions, prioritizes high-impact issues, and continuously tracks improvements after changes are implemented. The AI agent requires anonymized customer feedback data, service performance metrics, and resolution timelines. The key benefits include faster identification of root causes, reduced manual effort, improved accuracy, and proactive decision-making. By leveraging Agentic AI, organizations can move from reactive problem-solving to continuous service improvement, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction and stronger client relationships.

Learner's Submission:

It’s essential to address key ethical considerations to ensure responsible use when Integrating Generative AI into daily operations. First, data privacy is critical because AI systems rely on large datasets that might contain sensitive or personal information. Mishandling this data can lead to breaches, loss of trust, and regulatory penalties. To manage this risk, organizations should enforce strict data governance practices, including anonymization and compliance with privacy laws. Second, fairness and bias must be considered, as AI models can unintentionally perpetuate biases present in training data, resulting in unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Regular audits of AI outputs and the use of diverse, representative datasets can help check this issue. Finally, explainability is vital because AI decisions can be complex and opaque, making it difficult for users to understand or trust the system. Lack of transparency can hinder accountability and decision-making. To address this, companies should adopt explainable AI techniques and provide clear documentation or dashboards that outline how decisions are made. By proactively managing these risks, businesses can integrate AI responsibly and maintain trust among stakeholders – and with this Generative Ai can be incorporated into daily operations effectively and efficiently.



Clear and well-written submission that effectively explains the three key ethical considerations, why they matter, and how to manage each risk. The response is structured, relevant, and aligns well with Responsible AI principles, with only minor tightening needed for conciseness.



Learner's Submission:

Data Privacy and Security Why it matters: Generative AI models often require large datasets for training or fine-tuning. If employees input proprietary code, sensitive client information, or protected intellectual property into public AI tools, that data may become part of the model’s permanent training set, leading to data leaks or regulatory non-compliance Algorithmic Fairness and Bias Why it matters: AI models are trained on historical data that may contain societal biases regarding race, gender, or age. If these models are used to assist in hiring, performance reviews, or customer service, they may inadvertently automate and scale discrimination, leading to reputational damage and legal liability. Transparency and Explainability Why it matters: Generative AI often functions as a "black box," making it difficult to understand how it reached a specific conclusion or generated a specific piece of content. In a business context, being unable to explain a decision to a stakeholder or auditor can erode trust and make it difficult to correct errors or "hallucinations."



The submission clearly identifies three important Responsible AI considerations and explains why each matters in a business context. To strengthen it further, briefly add one risk-mitigation approach for each point (such as data governance controls, bias audits, or explainable AI tools) to fully meet the task requirements.
